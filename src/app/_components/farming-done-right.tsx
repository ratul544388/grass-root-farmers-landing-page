          All our animals are raised on non-GMO pasture where they roam and
          feedâ€”no antibiotics, no hormones. Living right results in meat
          that&apos;s richer in flavor and mountains more nutritious than
          conventionally raised meat.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-center">
          As a co-op, we partner with farmers who practice regenerative farming
          which is better for the animals, the soil, the environment, and your
          health. Take a bite of Grass Roots meat knowing that it is the most
          nutritious and best-tasting meat out there.
